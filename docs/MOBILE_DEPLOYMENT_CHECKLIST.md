# Mobile App Deployment - Implementation Checklist

**Issue:** #32 - APK Deployment
**Branch:** `feature/32-apk-deployment`
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅

---

## Phase 1: Initial Setup ✅

- [x] Create `eas.json` configuration file
- [x] Configure build profiles (development, preview, production)
- [x] Add `build-mobile` job to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- [x] Set up Expo/EAS authentication in GitHub Actions
- [x] Update `ci/build.sh` with mobile app build function
- [x] Add `EXPO_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Update README with documentation links

**Files Changed:**
- `app/eas.json` (new)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `ci/build.sh`
- `docs/MOBILE_APP_DEPLOYMENT.md` (new)
- `docs/MOBILE_BUILD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (new)
- `docs/MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (new)
- `README.md`

## Phase 2: Artifact Management (TODO)

- [ ] Remove `--no-wait` flag from build command
- [ ] Wait for EAS build completion in pipeline
- [ ] Download APK artifact from EAS
- [ ] Upload APK to GitHub Actions artifacts
- [ ] Add APK to GitHub Releases
- [ ] Create release automation workflow
- [ ] Add build status notifications

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Key Changes Needed:**
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Build Android APK
  working-directory: app
  run: eas build --platform android --profile production --non-interactive
  # Remove --no-wait

- name: Download APK
  run: eas build:download --output=./build/app-release.apk

- name: Upload APK Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: app-release-apk
    path: ./build/app-release.apk
```

---

## Phase 3: Google Play Distribution (TODO)

- [ ] Create Google Play Console project
- [ ] Generate service account JSON
- [ ] Add `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` to GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Configure AAB (App Bundle) build instead of APK
- [ ] Set up internal testing track
- [ ] Automate upload to Play Console
- [ ] Configure release notes generation

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Key Changes:**
```json
// In eas.json
"production": {
  "android": {
    "buildType": "app-bundle"  // Change from "apk"
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 4: Version Management (TODO)

- [ ] Add automatic version bumping
- [ ] Integrate with semantic versioning
- [ ] Generate version from git tags
- [ ] Update `app.json` version automatically
- [ ] Create changelog from commits
- [ ] Tag releases automatically

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

**Tools to Consider:**
- `semantic-release`
- `standard-version`
- Custom version bump script

---

## Phase 5: Multi-Environment Builds (TODO)

- [ ] Create environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Add staging environment
- [ ] Configure different API endpoints
- [ ] Add environment selection in builds
- [ ] Create separate build profiles
- [ ] Document environment setup

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Testing Checklist

### Before Merging to Main

- [ ] Test build locally with `eas build --platform android --profile preview --local`
- [ ] Verify `EXPO_TOKEN` is set in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Test GitHub Actions workflow on feature branch
- [ ] Verify build triggers on push to main
- [ ] Check build status on Expo dashboard
- [ ] Download and install APK on test device
- [ ] Verify app functionality on physical device
- [ ] Test all critical user flows
- [ ] Check app performance and stability

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor first production build
- [ ] Verify APK downloads successfully
- [ ] Test installation on multiple Android devices
- [ ] Check app size (should be < 50MB)
- [ ] Verify all features work offline
- [ ] Test database migrations
- [ ] Check WebSocket connections
- [ ] Verify authentication flows

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No automatic APK download** - Must manually download from Expo dashboard
2. **Manual versioning** - Version must be updated in `app.json` manually
3. **No release automation** - No automatic GitHub Releases creation
4. **Build monitoring** - No notifications when build completes

### Workarounds
- Download APK from https://expo.dev dashboard
- Update version manually before pushing to main
- Monitor builds via Expo dashboard or CLI

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Revert workflow changes:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits
   git push origin feature/32-apk-deployment
   ```

2. **Remove mobile build job:**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Comment out `build-mobile` job
   - Update `build-push` needs to only `[run-tests]`

3. **Build manually:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

---

## Performance Metrics

### Build Times (Approximate)
- **EAS Cloud Build**: 10-15 minutes
- **Local Build**: 5-8 minutes (requires Android SDK)
- **GitHub Actions Job**: 2-3 minutes (triggers build only)

### Build Sizes
- **Current APK**: ~TBD (check after first build)
- **Target Size**: < 50 MB
- **Uncompressed**: ~TBD
